# Mama-s-Restaurant-Management-System
This C++ application isn't just a menu—it's an exploration of efficiency.
# Overview
A C++ based management tool designed to streamline restaurant operations. This project focuses on the practical application of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to solve real-world problems such as menu organization, item searching, and budget-constrained decision making.
# Key Features & Implementation
-**Menu Management:** Displays a structured list of available food items including their ID, Name, Price (in Tk), and Satisfaction Score.

-**Optimized Sorting:** Implements the Merge Sort algorithm ($O(n \log n)$) to organize the menu based on pricing.

-**Efficient Searching:** Utilizes Binary Search to allow users to quickly find items by name.

**-Decision-Making Algorithms:**
    -**Greedy Approach:** A feature to help customers select the maximum number of food items possible within a specific budget. 
    -**Dynamic Programming (0/1 Knapsack):** An advanced optimization feature that calculates the combination of items providing the maximum satisfaction for a given budget.
    
-**Order & Billing:** A simple interface to take customer orders and generate instant bills.

#Technologies Used
-**Language:** C++

-**Concepts:** Object-Oriented Logic (Structs), Recursion (Merge Sort), Optimization (Greedy & DP)
